# Express Book Reviews API

## Project Overview
    You will have the chance to practice and put your skills, knowledge, and abilities to use Node.JS & Express.JS by developing Online Book review application in your final project.

## FINAL PROJECT SCENARIO
    In this project you will assume the role of a back-end developer working for an online retailer selling books. You have been tasked with developing a server-side application that stores, retrieves and manages book ratings and reviews.

### This server-side application is required to provide the following features and capabilities to allow users to:
    - Retrieve a list of all books available in the bookshop
    - Search for specific books and retrieve their details based on the bookâ€™s ISBN code, author names and titles
    - Retrieve reviews/comments for specified books
    - Register as a new user of the application
    - Login to the application
    - Add a new review for a book (logged in users only)
    - Modify a book review (logged in users can modify only their own reviews)
    - Delete a book review (logged in users can delete only their own reviews)
    - (Multiple users) Access the application at the same time to view and manage different book reviews simultaneously
    - As is the case with most software development projects, different people in the team work on different parts of the application. - Another front-end developer in your team is working on the web-based client-side application that will communicate with your server-side application using REST. Therefore your job is to implement your server-side application as a RESTful web service. A software architect on your team has written the skeleton code for your server-side application using Node.js and Express.js.
